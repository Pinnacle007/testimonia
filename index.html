I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.

                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                    100% recommend! ”
